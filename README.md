# SNPFILT

Contains R notebooks with bash and R code used to filter data sets.
The 'TotalRawSNPs.vcf' output files generated for each data set using dDocent are too large to be deposited on github. 
Instead they can be downloaded as described from the original publications or can be made available upon request.
